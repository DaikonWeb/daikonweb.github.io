# Testing
Daikon was designed to be easily testable. It is perfectly suited to an outside-in approach and the use of Test Driven Development.
the tests in this section use the following libraries:
* [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/) as assertion library
* [mockito-kotlin](https://github.com/nhaarman/mockito-kotlin) as mocking library
* [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) as http client

If you want to see how we test Daikon you can clone the [Daikon repository](https://github.com/DaikonWeb/daikon) and take a look around.
